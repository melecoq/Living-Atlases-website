description: <p class="text-justify">CoopBioPlat brought together GBIF nodes in Argentina (SNDB), Brazil (SiBBr), Costa Rica (CRBio), France, Portugal and Spain to produce an institutional agreement to cooperate on developing national biodiversity data portals based on the ALA portal. The meeting also aimed to further the customization of the ALA Platform by GBIF Nodes. This 2nd meeting focused on IT developments. Developers among the project’s partners were assisted at the meeting by David Martin from ALA.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">CoopBioPlat was a Pilot Coordination Action, funded by ERANet-LAC of the European Commission, and was implemented over 18 months.</p>
